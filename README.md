# runChallengeApp for iOS
Track your running workouts of the current month and challenge yourself.

RunChallenge gives you an overview of your entire distance of your running workouts within the actual month. Every running workout which is stored in Apple Health counts. So it doesn't matter which App oder Device (iPhone, Apple Watch) your are using to track your runs.
You can set a personal challenge of the distance you want to run in this month. You get some extra informations of how your personal challenge is going.
With the available Homescreen Widgets can get an overview of your current numbers at a glance.

Run Challenge is availibe on the [Apple App Store.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/runchallengeapp/id1576105144)
